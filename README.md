# stm32l432kc-baremetal

## UART/USART Init, Read, Write ## 
Following the guide, https://github.com/cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide?tab=readme-ov-file
I am using an STM32L432kc, the guide uses and STM32F429. These differences are minimal, memory addresses/regions, offsets, and sizes are mostly different. 

## I^2C Init, Read, Write, R/W to or from registers ##
Another guide that uses the F4 series with an older I^2C Peripheral, flags and registers will differ.
